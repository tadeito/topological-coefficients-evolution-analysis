# topological-coefficients-evolution-analysis
some scripts to analyze how topological characteristics of (MI ARACNE-style) weighted networks change as we take the top n  interactions 

On this project we intend to:

generate a batch of subnetworks to be analyzed with cytoscapeÂ´s network analyzer

use the output from the batch analysis to generate a report with the topological coefficients of each subnetwork

The goal is to obtain enough information to decide an apropriate cut for the network
